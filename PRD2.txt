## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Implementation
1. Set up salary configuration structure

4. Documentation updates

## Logical Dependency Chain
1. Salary configuration must be set up first
2. Premium college database needs to be populated
3. Calculation engine requires configuration
4. UI integration depends on calculation engine

## Risks and Mitigations

### Data Accuracy
