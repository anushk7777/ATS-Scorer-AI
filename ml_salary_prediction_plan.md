# ML-Based Salary Prediction System - Planning Document

## Overview
This document outlines the data structure and analysis approach for developing a machine learning model that predicts appropriate salary projections based on ATS scores, experience levels, and market benchmarks.

## 1. Employee Experience-Based Grouping

### Group Classifications:
1. **Freshers (0 years)** - Entry-level candidates with no professional experience
2. **Junior (1 year)** - Candidates with exactly 1 year of experience
3. **Mid-level (2-4 years)** - Candidates with 2 years or more but less than 5 years
4. **Senior (5+ years)** - Experienced professionals with 5 or more years

### Data Structure for Experience Groups:
```json
{
  "experience_groups": {
    "freshers": {
      "years_range": "0",
      "employees": [],
      "market_data": {}
    },
    "junior": {
      "years_range": "1",
      "employees": [],
      "market_data": {}
    },
    "mid_level": {
      "years_range": "2-4",
      "employees": [],
      "market_data": {}
    },
    "senior": {
      "years_range": "5+",
      "employees": [],
      "market_data": {}
    }
  }
}
```

## 2. Salary Gap Analysis Framework

### Market Benchmark Data Collection:
- **Industry Standards**: Collect current market rates for each role and experience level
- **Geographic Factors**: Account for location-based salary variations
- **Company Size**: Consider startup vs enterprise salary differences
- **Technology Stack**: Factor in technology-specific premium rates

### Salary Gap Calculation Formula:
```
Salary Gap (%) = ((Market Rate - Current Salary) / Current Salary) * 100
Required Hike (%) = Salary Gap (%)
```

### Data Structure for Salary Analysis:
```json
{
  "employee_salary_analysis": {
    "employee_id": "string",
    "role": "string",
    "experience_group": "string",
    "current_salary": "number",
    "market_rate": "number",

    "required_hike_percentage": "number",
    "location": "string",
    "company_size": "string",
    "technology_stack": "array"
  }
}
```

## 3. ATS Score Mapping

### ATS Score Components:
- **Format Score** (0-100): Resume structure and formatting
- **Content Score** (0-100): Relevant skills and experience
- **Keyword Match** (0-100): Job-specific keyword alignment
- **Overall ATS Score** (0-100): Weighted average of all components

### Mapping Structure:
```json
{
  "ats_score_mapping": {
    "employee_id": "string",
    "experience_group": "string",
    "ats_scores": {
      "format_score": "number",
      "content_score": "number",
      "keyword_match": "number",
